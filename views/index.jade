				ol.about-rules-list.white-box About This App
					li.about-rule To check the availability, name, and address of a station, simply tap a bike icon on the map.
					li.about-rule Each station displays its bike availability in the <strong>blue</strong> box and dock availability in the <strong>orange</strong> box.
					li.about-rule For a complete list of stations and availabilities, click on the 'stations' tab. You can click on any station there to be shown where it is on the map.
					li.about-rule To find a route to the station nearest to you, press the crosshairs button farthest to the left.
					li.about-rule To find the closest station to a place other than where you currently are, use the 'locate' tab to the left of the timer. This feature works best with landmarks, street-crossings, addresses, etc.
					li.about-rule This app provides a 30-minute timer for your convenience. It will sound when you have 10, 5, 1, and 0 minutes remaining to remind you to re-dock your bicycle.

				ol.about-rules-list.white-box Getting Started
					li.about-rule To begin using the bikeshare, you need either a 24-Hour Pass or an Annual Membership. This can only be purchased with a credit or debit card.
					li.about-rule After purchasing either a 24-Hour Pass or an Annual Membership, you have access to unlimited 30 minute rides during your Pass or Membership period. 
					li.about-rule All trips 30 minutes or less are included with your Pass or Membership, and trips longer than 30 minutes will incur the usage fees above.
					li.about-rule When a bike is checked out, the station will beep for 30 seconds. The bike must be removed from the dock before this time expires or it will become available for rent again.
					li.about-rule When returning a bike, push it firmly into the station until you hear a beeping sound. If the bike is not pushed in all the way, it will not register with the system and it will still be considered checked out!
					li.about-rule You may only check out one bike at a time with any given membership.
					li.about-rule Station hours of operation are 5:30am - 12:00am 365 days a year.
